# Barcode Image Fixer

This project aims to improve the accuracy and readability of distorted barcode images using advanced image processing techniques. Barcode scanners often struggle with images that are blurred, rotated, or contain noise, leading to incorrect or failed readings. To address this, the project applies several key concepts: thresholding to convert grayscale images into binary, morphological operations (dilation and erosion) to repair gaps and smooth out distortions, and noise reduction techniques like Gaussian blur. Additionally, edge detection and automatic rotation correction realign the barcode for optimal readability. Finally, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is used to extract the barcode data. Built with Python, OpenCV, and Tesseract OCR, this project enhances barcode recognition in real-world scenarios where images may be less than ideal, ensuring higher accuracy and efficiency in scanning applications.
